                <p>Congrats on taking your first steps into fighting game literacy! Herein are the very basics of what you'll need to know going forward.</p>
                
                <h2>Step One: Input Naming Conventions</h2>
                <p>There are a few different ways players like to abbreviate inputs for things like combo notation, where if one were to list each move verbatim you'd be reading an article to learn a BnB. Generally controls for fighting games are divided into strengths like so, in descending order.</p>
                
                <ol>
                    
                        <li><strong>Light Punches/Kicks</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Medium Punches/Kicks</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Heavy Punches/Kicks</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Special Moves</strong></li>
                    
                </ol>
                
                <p>The two main methods of shorthand stem from Street Fighter (Or more broadly, <em>traditional fighters</em>) and another genre, called <strong>anime fighters</strong>, such as Blazblue or the Guilty Gear series. Let's start with the former.</p>
                
                <p>Traditional fighers use a namings scheme very close to the list above, listing the button being pressed (e.g. Medium Kick) or the name of the special move being performed. For example: f.MP > MP > c.MK > Hadouken</p>
                
                <p>Carats are used to separate the individual unputs, and prefixes can be added to denote character position or directional inputs, e.g. crouching or holding a direction with your controller. Common prefixes are as follows:</p>
                
                <ul>    
                    <li><strong>f. = Forward directional</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>b. = Backward directional</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>c. = Crouching</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>df. = Down-forward directional</strong></li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>It is worth noting that while there are many traditional fighters, they do not all use the same move button (which are more commonly referred to as Normals) notation. Street Fighter may use the MP MK, etc. convention, but games like King of Fighters have their normals assigned letters instead, e.g. f.A as opposed to f.LP. It may sound intimidating but not to worry, picking it up is much easier than it seems.</p>
                
                <p>Even more uniquely, anime fighters employ something called <strong>Numpad Notation</strong>, as moves within this genre make more varied use of the controls afforded to fighting games as a whole. Directions, instead of using letter abbreviations, are assigned to the titular numpad in this layout and order:</p>
                
                
                <p>
                    <strong>7 8 9</strong><br>
                    <strong>4 5 6</strong><br>
                    <strong>1 2 3</strong><br>
                </p>
                
                
                <p>Each number corresponds to it's cardinal direction, with 5 being neutral. So a f.LP would instead be written as 6LP, and b.HK would be 4HK. Anime games also have no standardized nomenclature for their normals across all games, so be sure to check which yours uses. Guilty Gear, for example, uses words like Slash and Heavy Slash in place of the medium buttons. </p>
                
                <p>Numpad notation in particular is very useful for abbreviating special moves, which we will discuss next.</p>
                
                <h2>Special Moves</h2>
                
                <p>Here we will discuss briefly what a special move is, the three most common types, and the most common vernacular associated with them. It should be noted that while there are names for each of the moves listed here, the purpose of this list is both to demonstrate common inputs and their history, as well as different types of special moves, their uses, and shorthand for these motions; e.g. if someone were to say, "So and So's fireball uses a DP input." you will be equipped with the knowledge to understand what was said.</p>
                
                <dl>
                    <dt>Dragon Punch</dt>
                    <dd>Using a 623 motion with a variety of buttons, and also referred to as a DP, Shoryuken, or more broadly an invincible wakeup option (as not all moves that use the input look the same, despite their functioning similarly) the Dragon Punch originates, as all of the three detailed here do, from Street Fighter. It is generally an uppercutting move with invincibility frames and high recovery, and is most often used as a "get off me" option during an opponent's pressure. It is worth noting that not all moves that use 623 inputs are inherently invincible, but it is the most common input for moves of that nature. As with everything in the FGC, it varies from game to game, and even character to character. Always make sure to study your character's moveset and note which of your options may apply to this use case, as is may not be an option you expected.</dd>
                    <dt>Tatsumaki</dt>
                    <dd>The Tatsumaki (or Tatsu for short), uses a 214 motion, and again originates from Street Fighter. Originally it was a forward advancing spin kick, but this input now has a much broader use case than the DP's 623 motion, and can be associated with really any kind of move, from command dashes to fireballs.</dd>
                    <dt>Fireball</dt>
                    <dd>Another extremely widely used input type, a 236 or Hadouken input can be used for a myriad of move types, but the most quintessential is the titular Fireball. A projectile that moves across the screen, used to keep your opponent at a distance or punish them without coming too close. The input itself is not beholden to any move type, but knowing it and understanding the use case of the Fireball move type is integral to understanding fighting games.</dd>
