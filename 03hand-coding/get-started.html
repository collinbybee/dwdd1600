                <p>Congrats on taking your first steps into fighting game literacy! Herein are the very basics of what you'll need to know going forward.</p>
                
                <h2>Step One: Input Naming Conventions</h2>
                <p>There are a few different ways players like to abbreviate inputs for things like combo notation, where if one were to list each move verbatim you'd be reading an article to learn a BnB. Generally controls for fighting games are divided into strengths like so, in descending order.</p>
                
                <ol>
                    
                        <li><strong>Light Punches/Kicks</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Medium Punches/Kicks</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Heavy Punches/Kicks</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Special Moves</strong></li>
                    
                </ol>
                
                <p>The two main methods of shorthand stem from Street Fighter (Or more broadly, <em>traditional fighters</em>) and another genre, called <strong>anime fighters</strong>, such as Blazblue or the Guilty Gear series. Let's start with the former.</p>
                
                <p>Traditional fighers use a namings scheme very close to the list above, listing the button being pressed (e.g. Medium Kick) or the name of the special move being performed. For example: f.MP > MP > c.MK > Hadouken</p>
                
                <p>Carats are used to separate the individual unputs, and prefixes can be added to denote character position or directional inputs, e.g. crouching or holding a direction with your controller. Common prefixes are as follows:</p>
                
                <ul>    
                    <li><strong>f. = Forward directional</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>b. = Backward directional</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>c. = Crouching</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>df. = Down-forward directional</strong></li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>It is worth noting that while there are many traditional fighters, they do not all use the same move button (which are more commonly referred to as Normals) notation. Street Fighter may use the MP MK, etc. convention, but games like King of Fighters have their normals assigned letters instead, e.g. f.A as opposed to f.LP. It may sound intimidating but not to worry, picking it up is much easier than it seems.</p>
                
                <p>Even more uniquely, anime fighters employ something called <strong>Numpad Notation</strong>, as moves within this genre make more varied use of the controls afforded to fighting games as a whole. Directions, instead of using letter abbreviations, are assigned to the titular numpad in this layout and order:</p>
                
                
                <p>
                    <strong>7 8 9</strong><br>
                    <strong>4 5 6</strong><br>
                    <strong>1 2 3</strong><br>
                </p>
                
                
                <p>Each number corresponds to it's cardinal direction, with 5 being neutral. So a f.LP would instead be written as 6LP, and b.HK would be 4HK. Anime games also have no standardized nomenclature for their normals across all games, so be sure to check which yours uses. Guilty Gear, for example, uses words like Slash and Heavy Slash in place of the medium buttons. </p>
                
                <p>Numpad notation in particular is very useful for abbreviating special moves, which we will discuss next.</p>
